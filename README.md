# BASIC-PROJECTS README

This repository contains three Python programs for different purposes:

1. **Credit Card Validator Program:** A program that validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. It checks whether a given credit card number is potentially valid or not.

2. **Caesar Cipher Encryption Program:** A program that implements a basic Caesar cipher encryption. It allows you to encrypt a message by shifting the characters by a specified number of positions.

3. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:** A simple text-based game where you can play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The program determines the winner based on your choice and the computer's choice.

## How to Use Each Program

### Credit Card Validator Program:

1. Run the program by executing `credit_card_validator.py`.
2. Enter a credit card number when prompted.
3. The program will tell you whether the entered credit card number is valid or not.

### Caesar Cipher Encryption Program:

1. Run the program by executing `caesar_cipher_encryption.py`.
2. Enter a message you want to encrypt.
3. Enter a shift value (an integer) for the encryption.
4. The program will provide you with the encrypted message.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:

1. Run the program by executing `rock_paper_scissors.py`.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose either rock, paper, or scissors.
3. The computer will randomly select its choice.
4. The program will determine the winner and display the result.

## Notes

- These programs are designed for educational and practice purposes.
- The Caesar cipher encryption is a basic form of encryption and is not suitable for secure applications.
- Enjoy playing Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer, but remember it's a simple text-based game for fun.

Feel free to explore, modify, or extend these programs as you continue your journey in computer science and programming!

If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to reach out.

Happy coding!
